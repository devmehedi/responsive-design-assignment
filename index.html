                        All that stuff about history repeating itself is hogwash. Though history does not repeat, its themes do and that is where it gets interesting: moderns love to imagine otherwise, but Homo sapiens have scarcely changed since the dawn of history itself.</p>

                        <p class="description">Every source for the historian is suspect. Like the newspapers, books and magazines of our day, yesterday’s artifacts harbor the biases of the writer. </p>

                        <p class="description">It takes a critical mind to tease the facts from the bias. It takes a highly trained mind to not bring one’s own biases to the process. Yet more training to understand that however hard you try, your biases are still there.</p>

                        <p class="description">History is the greatest tool for honing the critical mind. Seldom does one not bring an opinion to the table in a fight over the meaning of history. It is part of who we are as humans—how we define who “we” and “they” are.</p>

                        <p class="description">So we are left with this fight against our own biases. History, properly understood, compels us to battle against the received wisdom of our childhood. By reaching into the deepest recesses of our psyche, it challenges us to think more clearly.</p>
